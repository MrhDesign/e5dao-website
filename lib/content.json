In the absence of command, it is difficult for the army to complete effective attack, defense and coordinated operations of various arms. In the Russian-Ukrainian war, due to the lack of modern command posts on the front line, the Russian side had to go to the front line to understand the front-line combat situation in real time. As a result, a large number of senior commanders were killed. Therefore, front-line commanders urgently need a lightweight, highly integrated, highly informationized, quickly deployable and quickly withdrawn mobile command post to convey combat assignments to individual soldiers and pass on the front-line combat situation to the upper-level command agency.
