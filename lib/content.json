          "content": "In modern warfare, with the widespread use of high-altitude reconnaissance equipment and long-range precision strike weapons, the survivability of both forward and rear fixed command posts has been significantly reduced. In the absence of effective command, it becomes extremely difficult for armed forces to conduct coordinated offense, defense, and joint operations across different branches.\n\nThe Russia-Ukraine conflict has demonstrated that the lack of modern forward command posts forced senior officers to move closer to the frontline in order to obtain real-time battlefield information, resulting in substantial casualties among high-ranking commanders.\n\nFrontline commanders therefore urgently require a lightweight, highly integrated, information-driven, rapidly deployable and easily retractable mobile command post. Such a system enables the dissemination of operational orders down to individual soldiers while simultaneously relaying frontline battlefield data to higher command levels. It embodies the concept of \"carrying the command post on the shoulder and holding the power of information in hand.\""
